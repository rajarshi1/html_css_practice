                Side-By-Side Postioning Demo
              </h1>
              <article>
                <div class="inline-blocks">
                  These two divs are positioned next to one another using <mark>display: inline-block</mark>
                </div>
                <div class="inline-blocks">
                    Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organized. I've used a reset ensure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a button margin to make it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inine elements.

                  <div class="inline-blocks1 float">
                    These two positioned using <mark>float: left</mark>.
                  </div>
                  <div class="inline-blocks1 float">
                    you can see that, even though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually rendered on the same page. This may not be a huge deal in these first examples, but..

                  What if I want my sdie-by-side elements to take up the full width of the parent element? I can set the width of each to 50% , right?
                </div>
              
              
              
                <div class="blocks">
                  Wrong! Because, together, the two inline block elements will addd up to 100% of the available width, but that doesn't account for the space between.
